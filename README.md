# Macbook Ansible Playbook

Almost all of this comes from oxyc ['oxyc/mac-playbook'](https://github.com/oxyc/mac-playbook).
The playbook contained in this repo delegates some functionality to [`geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook`](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook)'s playbook and does some other things.

*Note: Do NOT install anything you haven't looked throughâ€“this is a highly opinionated set of configurations. Running the playbook will affect pretty much every aspect of your environment so for others than me, this is mostly a reference point.*

*See also*:

## Installation

    # Pre tasks
    Log into Mac App Store (App Store in Spotlight)
    From a terminal:
        xcode-select --install

    # Create git repo dir
    mkdir -p ~/git/

    # Clone this repository to your local drive.
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/bartdorlandt/macbook-playbook.git ~/git/macbook-playbook

    # copy and edit the .env.yml file
    cp env.yml-template .env.yml
    vi .env.yml

    # export path so ansible binaries are going to be on path. (use the correct version, `python -V`)
    export PATH=~/Library/Python/3.9/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH

    # Install dependencies for MAC
    ./run install

    # Run the playbook (Some casks might need an interactive password during installation).
    ./run provision


### Running a specific set of tagged tasks

You can filter which part of the provisioning process to run by specifying a set of tags using `TAGS="<tag1>,<tag2>"` flag. The tags can be retrieved using:

    ./run list-tags

example:

    TAGS=dotfiles,homebrew ./run all

using playbook steps:

    ./run step
