# Macbook Ansible Playbook

Almost all of this comes from oxyc ['oxyc/mac-playbook'](https://github.com/oxyc/mac-playbook).
The playbook contained in this repo delegates some functionality to [`geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook`](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook)'s playbook and does some other things.

*Note: Do NOT install anything you haven't looked throughâ€“this is a highly opinionated set of configurations. Running the playbook will affect pretty much every aspect of your environment so for others than me, this is mostly a reference point.*

*See also*:

- [`geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook`](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook) (the actual playbook used to provision)

## What you get
By default, it will install an environment that is suited for my personal needs. Including but not limited to the tools and programs I use along with several configuration setups and dotfiles.

Along with that it will set most of the settings, including the dock layout.

# Installation

## Pre tasks
Log into Mac App Store (App Store in Spotlight)
From a terminal:

    xcode-select --install

## Create git repo dir

    mkdir -p ~/git/
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/bartdorlandt/macbook-playbook.git ~/git/macbook-playbook
    cd ~/git/macbook-playbook

    # install uv
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

    uv venv
    uv sync
    source .venv/bin/activate

## copy and edit the .env.yml file
    cp env.yml-template .env.yml
    vi .env.yml

## Install dependencies for MAC

    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
    git submodule update --init --recursive

## Run the playbook
(Some casks might need an interactive password during installation).

    ansible-playbook main.yml -K

# Running a specific set of tagged tasks

You can filter which part of the provisioning process to run by specifying a set of tags using `TAGS="<tag1>,<tag2>"` flag. The tags can be retrieved using:

    task list-tags

example:

    task TAGS=dotfiles,homebrew all

using playbook steps:

    task step
